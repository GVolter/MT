# Methodology

This project targets terminology-aware MT for the language pairs Romanian–Aromanian and English–Aromanian, using private parallel data and dictionary resources that are **never redistributed**.

Outline:
- Data preprocessing for Romanian, English, and Aromanian
- Terminology extraction and alignment using provided dictionaries
- Baseline MT/LLM setup for the above language pairs
- Fine-tuning NLLB-200 600M and open Romanian LLMs
- Terminology-aware integration (e.g., constraint decoding, lexicon biasing)
- Experimental setup and evaluation
